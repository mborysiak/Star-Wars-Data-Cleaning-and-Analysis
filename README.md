# Star Wars Data Cleaning and Analysis
This project was completed as part of the Dataquest curriculum. It takes data from FiveThirtyEight and further cleans it up for more straightforward analysis. It demonstrates my ability to take a messy dataset with null values and transform it into something useful. At the end, a few variables are explored such as what movie has the best ranking, which movies have the most people seen, and breakdowns among gender and age.

##Techniques usedÂ¶
- pandas for data cleaning
- matplotlib for data visualization
